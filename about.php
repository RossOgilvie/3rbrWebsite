	<h2>About Us</h2>
	
	<p>3rd Rose Bay (Judean) Rover Crew is based in the eastern suburbs of Sydney. We are an open crew, usually meeting on Sunday evenings at 7pm (See our <a href="calendar">Calendar</a>). We are a social Crew who also get involved in adventurous activities and service work throughout the community, all whilst having a good time. Our activities have included Dragon Skin, Moots, hikes, movie nights, caving and other rock related activities.</p>

	<p>We have two scarfs which reflects our heritage as a crew. The 3rd Rose Bay (Judean) Scout Group is light blue with 2 white edging stripes. The Crew scarf is navy blue with light blue and white edging and is only worn by knights.</p>
	
	<p>Our Hall is located in Vickery Ave, Rose Bay </p>
