  # Git to store control files. Files whose names begin with a period, as well
  # as the control files used by CVS, are protected by the FilesMatch directive
  # above.

  # not possible to block access to entire directories from .htaccess, because
  # <DirectoryMatch> is not allowed here.

  # directories from your webroot or otherwise protect them from being
  # downloaded.
